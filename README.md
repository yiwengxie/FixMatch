# FixMatch
This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of [FixMatch: Simplifying Semi-Supervised Learning with Consistency and Confidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685).
The official Tensorflow implementation is [here](https://github.com/google-research/fixmatch).

This code is only available in FixMatch (RandAugment).

### Monitoring training progress
```
tensorboard --logdir=<your out_dir>
```

## Requirements
- python 3.6+
- torch 1.4
- torchvision 0.5
- tensorboard
- numpy
- tqdm
- apex (optional)
